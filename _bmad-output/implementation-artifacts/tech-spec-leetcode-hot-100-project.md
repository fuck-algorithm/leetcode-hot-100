# Tech-Spec: leetcode-hot-100-project

**Created:** 2026-02-21T07:51:00Z

## Overview

### Problem Statement

Existing LeetCode Hot 100 visualization website that needs ongoing maintenance, feature development, and bug fixes.

### Solution

Continue iterative development using BMAD Quick Flow methodology for efficient feature delivery.

### Scope

**In Scope:**
- Feature development
- Bug fixes
- Performance improvements
- UI/UX enhancements

**Out of Scope:**
- Major architecture changes
- Backend development

## Context for Development

### Codebase Patterns

- React functional components with hooks
- TypeScript for type safety
- CSS modules for styling
- i18next for internationalization

### Files to Reference

| File | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |

### Technical Decisions

- Use existing React patterns
- Maintain TypeScript strict mode
- Keep i18n for multi-language support

## Implementation Plan

### Tasks

This is an ongoing maintenance and feature development project. Tasks will be defined per feature request or bug fix.

**General Task Template:**
- [ ] Task N: Clear action description
  - File: `path/to/file.ext`
  - Action: Specific change to make
  - Notes: Any implementation details

**Initial Task Categories:**
1. Bug fixes - Address reported issues
2. Feature development - Add new functionality
3. Performance optimization - Improve load times and responsiveness
4. UI/UX improvements - Enhance user experience

### Acceptance Criteria

Each task will have specific acceptance criteria defined at task creation time.

**Standard AC Format:**
- [ ] AC N: Given [precondition], when [action], then [expected result]

**General Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] AC1: Given the application is running, when users navigate to any page, then the page loads without errors
- [ ] AC2: Given the application is running, when users switch language, then all UI text updates to the selected language
- [ ] AC3: Given a user has completed problems, when they return to the site, then their progress is persisted

## Additional Context

### Dependencies

- React 18
- TypeScript 4.9
- react-router-dom 7
- i18next

### Testing Strategy

- React Testing Library
- Jest

### Notes

- BMAD Quick Flow initialized for this project
